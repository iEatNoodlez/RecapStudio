**Which file?** Recap Studio comes in two editions, both free, for Windows and now for Linux. They keep the same projects and settings, and installing one over the other switches between them. Each copy updates to its own edition.

- **Recap Studio Lite**: the whole app, with no plugins. You can add single plugins in Settings → Plugins.
  - Windows: `Recap-Studio-Lite-{version}-setup.exe` (installs it) or `Recap-Studio-Lite-{version}-portable.zip`.
  - Linux: `Recap-Studio-Lite-{version}-x86_64.AppImage`.
- **Recap Studio Full Suite**: Lite with [Recap Studio's plugins](https://github.com/iEatNoodlez/RecapStudio-Plugins#readme) built in: finding the series, what's trending to make a project of, automation, posting to YouTube, branding, passing a site's Cloudflare check yourself in a window, more languages and file types.
  - Windows: `Recap-Studio-Full-Setup-{version}.exe` or `Recap-Studio-Full-Portable-{version}.zip`.
  - Linux: `Recap-Studio-Full-{version}-x86_64.AppImage`.

Copies on 0.1.x update to Lite. To move to Full Suite, install its setup over Lite once.

**On Linux:** an AppImage runs on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 36 or newer (64-bit). Make it executable (`chmod +x`, or Properties → Allow executing), then start it. [Linux](https://github.com/iEatNoodlez/RecapStudio/blob/main/docs/linux.md) in the docs covers where files go, fonts, video encoding and Ubuntu 24.04's sandbox.

## What's new

- **Recap Studio for Linux:** both editions as AppImages, one file each that carries everything and updates itself like the Windows copies. Projects go in your Documents folder and settings in `~/.local/share/recap-studio`; first-run setup can add Recap Studio to your applications menu.
- **Fonts on Linux:** captions, thumbnails and re-lettered bubbles use Microsoft's fonts when they're installed, and the closest fonts your distribution has otherwise. Setup offers free look-alikes (Anton, Archivo Black, Comic Neue and Noto Sans, 4.7 MB). Windows keeps its own fonts, so its videos look as before.
- **When a video is done 1.1.0:** its command quotes each value so that nothing in a title can run, on Linux's shell as well as Windows'.
